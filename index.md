# Substance Over Flash

### Having an impact on cybersecurity problems by paying for what’s important
##### Michael Tanji / Alex Kreilein

*It’s been said that you can’t spend your way out of a security problem, but you wouldn’t know that by attending any large security conference. We absolutely need the solutions vendors provide; we don't need the corresponding entertainment. What is a better use of corporate money - magicians, boxers, and car raffles - or funding the next generation of practitioners, product users, and solution developers?*

It would be nice to think that we coined the phrase, but if we’re being honest, we probably stole it from someone and forgotten the source. It’s a phrase that is particularly apropos this week during the RSA Conference (RSAC) and it goes like this:

*Nobody is in the security business, not even security companies.  They’re just in business.*

The point being that creating solutions and getting them into the hands of people who need them takes money. It is why companies that have the greatest solutions still need a sales team. Likewise, developing solutions requires effort, and that effort deserves to be rewarded. 

But one question we keep asking ourselves – a question that constantly keeps tickling the backs of our minds - is whether what we’re spending to communicate value propositions is not coming at the expense of doing something more substantive? How might security conferences – and those who participate in them - add value to the security field writ large without a materially negative impact?

### A Moment for Introspection

Walk the vendor floor of any major security conference and stare in wonder at the booths filled with expensive furniture and electronics; ogle the cars being auctioned off; laugh at the tricks of magicians; and schlep hundreds of dollars’ worth of printed collateral and tchotchkes that will be filling the local garbage dump by this weekend and ask yourself:

*"Is that investment of capital producing a security ROI?"*

In response to the so-called “talent shortage” in security, industry has responded with “artificial” human intelligence and automation. Yet if you’ve been a security decision-maker for any length of time you know that the true total cost of ownership of anyone’s magic blinky box is the box, plus the humans needed to make the box work. Rare is the solution that actually reduces headcount. This is a problem on multiple levels: companies are competing with each other (and solution providers) for talent; the more sophisticated the solution the rarer the talent needed to make it work; and absent adequate talent (period) the need for solutions wanes.

Consider the status quo when it comes to promoting security solutions, and ask yourself what is more valuable to your company, your customers, and the field: a new practitioner or a piece of swag?

### Call to Action: Give 1%

What follows is a thought experiment that uses [RSAC](https://www.rsaconference.com/usa) (a very large and well-done conference) and the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/) (a highly regarded source of technical security training) as examples.

One way RSAC generates revenue is through vendor booth sales. Some very rough counting using the [vendor floor maps](https://www.rsaconference.com/usa/expo-and-sponsors) provided at the RSAC web site, and [their booth price list](https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/files/2020/rsac_2020_exhibit_sizes_prices.pdf), suggests booth sales produces about $10M in revenue (for the purposes of this experiment we’ll disregard any discounts or other pricing variances, as well as all the other ways RSAC generates revenue).  Imagine if the company were to reserve 1% of that $10M to directly support cybersecurity training with a $100,000 grant. At a rough average of $6,000 per class, RSAC would have paid for 16 SANS classes for aspirants to the field.

*“But guys, 16 freshly minted GIACs isn’t going to make a big difference in the ‘talent shortage’ problem.”*

You’re absolutely right. This would not have an impact on a sufficient scale, so let’s extend the experiment a little further: the estimated market for security products and services is somewhere around $150B globally. If everyone in security set aside 1% of what they made and donated it to a training fund - for those of you who want to check your answers in the back of the book - that’s 250,000 new GIACs. 

Now we’re cooking with gas.

Yes, this is a simplistic example with imperfect numbers, and no not everyone would see equal amounts of value by participating, but the overall point remains: the status quo is not moving the needle. For a company of any size, the reallocation of a minimal amount of money could have a much more significant impact on security than a magician, a gross of stress balls with the company logo, or sponsoring a race car. 

One sign of a good plan is how well it aligns the interests and incentives of all parties involved. Addressing the talent shortage in the aforementioned fashion works to the benefit of vendors, conferences, corporations, and individuals alike. It doesn’t just fund tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of new practitioners, it’s also funding:

- New product/service users.
- New product/service developers.
- New conference attendees.

A donation of *financial* capital, that fuels an injection of *human* capital, also helps to address issues like burn-out and other factors that are driving people out of the field, further exacerbating our people problems. Apropos then, the promulgation of the proposition that we should all put our money where our mouths are, when the theme of RSAC 2020 is the “Human Element.” 

### Closing Salvo

We can keep doing what we’re doing – the cybersecurity equivalent of ‘thoughts and prayers’ - or we can make a miniscule change that has the potential to have outsized returns. As investors and business people ourselves we’re not allergic to money, but we also believe that capitalism focused on security issues can and should work to make us all safer and stronger. We believe our proposal has the potential to do just that, look forward to the discussion that is sure to follow, and the formation of a corporate/non-profit partnership that could make it a reality.
